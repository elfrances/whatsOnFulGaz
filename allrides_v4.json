The ride finishes with a last relatively flat section along the lake.\n\nLong sections of this ride are on ice and snow; for the best ride experience we recommend that you enable Real Road Feel (RRF) in Settings.\n","cat":["Trails","Hilly"],"ele":"606","tou":"346","loc":"Baar, Zug, Switzerland","con":"Bjoern Rosner","ter":"00:05:59-rough road,00:06:01-mud,00:06:08-rough road,00:08:41-wooden bridge,00:08:47-smooth tarmac,00:09:18-mud,00:09:23-wooden bridge,00:09:27-mud,00:09:54-rough road,00:10;58-mud,00:11:20-rough road,00:11:30-mud,00:11:39-rough road,00:12:13-mud,00:12:31-rough road,00:12:45-mud,00:12:57-smooth tarmac,00:13:13-rough road,00:13:56-mud,00:14:02-rough road,00:14:10-mud,00:14:16-rough road,00:14:55-mud,00:16:03-rough road,00:16:33-mud,00:17:11-rough road,00:18:41-mud,00:19:19-rough road,00:20:30-mud,00:20:31-wooden bridge,00:20:36-mud,00:21:28-smooth tarmac,00:45:39-rough road,00:45:44-smooth tarmac,00:45:46-rough road,00:46:05-smooth tarmac,00:46:11-rough road,00:46:15-smooth tarmac,00:46:19-rough road,00:46:40-mud,00:47:00-smooth tarmac,00:47:07-mud,00:47:09-smooth tarmac,00:47:16-mud,00:47:33-smooth tarmac,00:47:41-rough road,00:47:52-mud,00:48:05-rough road,00:48:06-smooth tarmac,00:49:10-rough road,00:49:31-mud,00:49:54-rough road,00:50:37-mud,00:54:39-smooth tarmac,00:54:45-mud,00:56:36-rough road,00:56:44-mud,00:58:16-rough road,00:58:19-smooth tarmac,00:58:25-rough road,00:58:48-mud,01:00:22-rough road,01:00:26-smooth tarmac,01:03:24-rough road,01:03:36-mud,01:04:20-rough road,01:04:25-smooth tarmac"},"compType":"single","avatarMode":0,"hls":"","product":"fulgaz","workoutURL":"","views":105,"forceDownload":false,"a":{"image":["Hollgrotten-Zugerberg-In-Snow.jpg"],"file":["Hollgrotten-Zugerberg-working-seg.2.shiz"]},"u":1644371999242,"t":"Baar Höllgrotten to Oberwil via Zugerberg in the snow"},{"_id":"152f5678da4ae3d1a1059e16","appId":"55f780c682d4002ba4cc479077db57a400cbe240","vim1080":{"file":"1080P/Baie-Comeau-TT.mp4"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/Baie-Comeau-TT.mp4"},"vimMaster":{"file":"4K/Baie-Comeau-TT.mp4"},"meta":{"country":"all","released":"2022-02-15","dur":"0:21:02","dis":"9.36","des":"The Baie-Comeau Time Trial Course.\n\nFast, flat, traffic-free, sunny, and blue skies.\n\nMaximum attack!\n","cat":["Easy"],"ele":"87","tou":"74","loc":"Baie-Comeau, Québec, Canada","con":"Myriam Paquette","ter":""},"compType":"single","avatarMode":0,"hls":"","product":"fulgaz","workoutURL":"","views":125,"forceDownload":false,"a":{"image":["Baie-Comeau-TT.jpg"],"file":["Baie-Comeau-TT-working-seg.shiz"]},"u":1639424373568,"loc":{"lon":-68.2589798,"lat":49.1904564},"t":"Baie-Comeau TT"},{"_id":"0449ae09180c579e21cc49b0","appId":"55f780c682d4002ba4cc479077db57a400cbe240","vim1080":{"file":"1080P/Bailey-Island.mp4","sha":"e739feb7b0ccc822e7abc2e8470d6a32d6d86478c0a868a050ca51d9d3893909"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/Bailey-Island.mp4","sha":"69c1709c39924b2680092d5496ff586bdc14bdbc0fa206ec8368fb0c0b630045"},"vimMaster":{"file":"4K/Bailey-Island.mp4","sha":"e7212cd8f91cfe2eb2d9d1f7fbf307a50b05a13b65441d230a9423523c06ed3f"},"meta":{"country":"all","released":"2021-05-24","dur":"00:47:09","dis":"22.25","des":"Starting near  Dyer Corner and heading out on Rt 123,  this ride takes a left on Mountain Road and then a right on rt 24, crosses Orrs Island and then crosses a nationally historical architectural Cribstone bridge which was built without cement in the 1920’s  and designed to withstand the tides and winds of Maine on to Bailey Island, terminating at Lands End.

Loops are rides where the start and finish are at the same point, this lets you do multiple laps without getting weird distances in Strava etc. To ride multiple laps of a ride non-stop, go to Settings then select Laps from the Ride Modes menu.","cat":["Easy","Race","Loop"],"ele":"57","tou":"88","loc":"London, England","con":"Dan Grant","ter":""},"vim1080":{"file":"1080P/brompton.mp4","sha":"16a8fc0b067fb3fc01059f444cd0fd8b24fd61a45588a9fb05d58b18fd7a313b"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/brompton.mp4","sha":"70544be5572eefeab2adfacd2195e0f6fd01618207459b31b5488ee52b996ba8"},"vimMaster":{"file":""},"compType":"single","views":156,"hls":"https://fulgazhls.cachefly.net/file/fulgaz-videos/,1080P,720P,/brompton.mp4.cf/master.m3u8","a":{"image":["brompton.jpg"],"file":["brompton-google.shiz"]},"u":1483767095417,"loc":{"lat":51.505033,"lon":-0.132974},"t":"Brompton World Championships"},{"_id":"d2cf790060231a2e3786d9cb","appId":"55f780c682d4002ba4cc479077db57a400cbe240","vim1080":{"file":"1080P/Brugge-Oostende.mp4"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/Brugge-Oostende.mp4"},"vimMaster":{"file":"4K/Brugge-Oostende.mp4"},"meta":{"country":"all","released":"2021-08-03","dur":"01:29:52","dis":"46.70","des":"A stunning ride from Brugge to the Belgian coast at Oostende is a relatively flat ride and perfect if you're looking for something gentle to turn the legs over. ","cat":["Sightseeing","Easy"],"ele":"88","tou":"271","loc":"Brugge, Vlaanderen, Belgium","con":"Jos Pironet","ter":"00:49:09-rough road, 00:54:03-smooth tarmac, 01:04:20-rough road, 01:04:52-smooth tarmac, 01:08:59-wooden bridge, 01:09:04-smooth tarmac, 01:09:24-rough road, 01:11:12-smooth tarmac, 01:12:05-cobbles, 01:12:16-smooth tarmac, 01:12:30-rough road, 01:13:59-smooth tarmac, 01:14:04-rough road, 01:14:45-smooth tarmac, 01:18:44-rough road, 01:20:04-smooth tarmac, 01:22:15-rough road, 01:24:57-smooth tarmac, 01:26:20-cobbles, 01:27:37-rough road, 01:28:30-smooth tarmac"},"compType":"single","workoutURL":"","views":545,"hls":"","avatarMode":0,"product":"fulgaz","a":{"image":["Brugge-Oostende.jpg"],"file":["Brugge-Oostende-seg.shiz"]},"u":1624138274315,"loc":{"lon":3.2376957,"lat":51.1247559},"t":"Brugge Oostende"},{"_id":"98541ccf3a4e56521d4eaeae","appId":"55f780c682d4002ba4cc479077db57a400cbe240","vim1080":{"file":"1080P/Brugge-Oostende.mp4"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/Brugge-Oostende.mp4"},"vimMaster":{"file":"4K/Brugge-Oostende.mp4"},"meta":{"country":"all","released":"2021-08-03","workoutType":"Steady","dur":"01:29:52","dis":"46.70","des":"A stunning ride from Brugge to the Belgian coast at Oostende is a relatively flat ride and perfect if you're looking for something gentle to turn the legs over. ","cat":["Sightseeing","Easy"],"ele":"88","tou":"271","loc":"Brugge, Vlaanderen, Belgium","con":"Jos Pironet","ter":"00:49:09-rough road, 00:54:03-smooth tarmac, 01:04:20-rough road, 01:04:52-smooth tarmac, 01:08:59-wooden bridge, 01:09:04-smooth tarmac, 01:09:24-rough road, 01:11:12-smooth tarmac, 01:12:05-cobbles, 01:12:16-smooth tarmac, 01:12:30-rough road, 01:13:59-smooth tarmac, 01:14:04-rough road, 01:14:45-smooth tarmac, 01:18:44-rough road, 01:20:04-smooth tarmac, 01:22:15-rough road, 01:24:57-smooth tarmac, 01:26:20-cobbles, 01:27:37-rough road, 01:28:30-smooth tarmac"},"compType":"single","workoutURL":"","views":461,"hls":"","avatarMode":0,"product":"fulgaz","a":{"image":["Brugge-Oostende.jpg"],"file":["Brugge-Oostende-seg.shiz"]},"u":1624138274315,"loc":{"lon":3.2376957,"lat":51.1247559},"t":"Brugge Ostend endurance session"},{"_id":"0f5cdc8ae27ac02944173cfa","appId":"55f780c682d4002ba4cc479077db57a400cbe240","vim1080":{"file":"1080P/Brundage-Mountain-Lookout.mp4"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/Brundage-Mountain-Lookout.mp4"},"vimMaster":{"file":"4K/Brundage-Mountain-Lookout.mp4"},"meta":{"country":"all","released":"2022-01-11","dur":"02:08:04","dis":"40.76","des":"McCall Idaho is home to Brundage Mountain Ski Resort.

This ride takes you in a loop from the main park entry to one of the side entry along mainly single tracks with nice views of the reservoir and back.","cat":["Trails"],"ele":"438","tou":"345","loc":"Calero County Park, California, USA","con":"Alexis Berthillier","ter":"00:00:01-gravel,00:28:17-wooden bridge, 00:28:20-gravel 00:52:04-smooth tarmac, 00:52:30-gravel"},"compType":"single","workoutURL":"","avatarMode":0,"hls":"","product":"fulgaz","views":109,"forceDownload":false,"a":{"image":["Calero-County-Park-Loop.jpg"],"file":["Calero-County-Park-Loop.shiz"]},"u":1629496068559,"loc":{"lon":-121.806969,"lat":37.193203},"t":"Calero County Park Loop"},{"_id":"704782663f2d22317f8232bc","appId":"55f780c682d4002ba4cc479077db57a400cbe240","vim1080":{"file":"1080P/Camino-De-Las-Altas-Cumbres.mp4"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/Camino-De-Las-Altas-Cumbres.mp4"},"vimMaster":{"file":"4K/Camino-De-Las-Altas-Cumbres.mp4"},"meta":{"country":"all","released":"2022-05-03","ride_notes":"","dur":"2:30:26","dis":"44.35","des":"A lovely rolling ride through the hill under some moody skies, and bright blue patches will keep you motivated and riding forward!","cat":["Hilly"],"ele":"1216","tou":"722","loc":"Parque Nacional Quebrada del Condorito, Alta Gracia, Argentina","con":"Marcelo Mourier","ter":"00:04:11-rough road,00:04:28-smooth tarmac"},"compType":"single","avatarMode":0,"forceDownload":false,"hls":"","product":"fulgaz","workoutURL":"","views":94,"a":{"image":["Camino-De-Las-Altas-Cumbres.jpg"],"file":["Camino-De-Las-Altas-Cumbres-working-seg.shiz"]},"u":1649797089243,"loc":{"lon":-64.5432587,"lat":-31.5966301},"t":"Camino de Las Altas Cumbres"},{"_id":"8188c52ee2fb07b031e3ca89","appId":"55f780c682d4002ba4cc479077db57a400cbe240","vim1080":{"file":"1080P/Camino-Del-Cuadrado.mp4"},"vim720":{"file":"720P/Camino-Del-Cuadrado.mp4"},"vimMaster":{"file":"4K/Camino-Del-Cuadrado.mp4"},"meta":{"country":"all","released":"2022-05-10","ride_notes":"","dur":"1:09:40","dis":"19.02","des":"Camino del Cuadrado is a paved mountain pass in the Sierras Chicas of Córdoba, that connects the towns of Rio Ceballos to the east with La Falda to the west.

Of course, what goes up must also come down and the views across the River Derwent and back to kunanyi / Mt Wellington, are worth it.\n\nThe 90km bike course includes plenty of variation to keep you focused. First, head south along Castray Esplanade, before U-turning at Battery Point and riding through the historic port of Hobart including Franklins Wharf and Constitution Dock. The highway underpass will bring you out to the Western side of the Tasman Highway. Continue north towards Queens Domain and Cornelian Bay. Pay attention heading into the technical residential streets of Lutana, Derwent Park, and Goodwood and be ready to change down gears as this section includes the first significant climbs of the day.\n\nFrom Goodwood Road turn left to complete the Derwent Entertainment Centre (DEC)/MyState Arena loop. This marks the start of the first of two 34km laps. Heading South, complete two U-turns at Grass Tree Hill and Risdon. The course will continue north along East Derwent Highway and the River Derwent. Get familiar with Otago Hill, as you’ll conquer it four times within the two laps! Return over Bowen Bridge to commence your second lap with another loop around the Derwent Entertainment Centre (DEC)/MyState Arena.\n\nAfter completing your second lap, ride south again back through the technical section of Lutana, Goodwood and Cornelian Bay.
